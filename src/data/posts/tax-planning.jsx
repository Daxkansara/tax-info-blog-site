        <h1>GST Basics for New Business Owners</h1>

        <p>Starting a new business in India comes with various compliance requirements, and understanding the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is paramount. GST is an indirect tax levied on the supply of goods and services. Here’s a basic guide for new business owners.</p>

        <h2>What is GST?</h2>
        <p>GST replaced multiple indirect taxes like VAT, service tax, and excise duty, creating a unified tax system. It's a destination-based tax, meaning it's collected by the state where the goods or services are consumed.</p>

        <h2>When is GST Registration Required?</h2>
        <p>GST registration is mandatory for businesses whose aggregate turnover exceeds a certain threshold limit. As of the current regulations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For suppliers of goods: ₹40 lakhs (₹20 lakhs for special category states).</li>
          <li>For suppliers of services: ₹20 lakhs (₹10 lakhs for special category states).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Registration is also mandatory under certain other conditions, such as inter-state supply, e-commerce operations, or liability under reverse charge mechanism, regardless of turnover.</p>

        <h2>Types of GST</h2>
        <p>There are three main components of GST:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>CGST (Central GST):</strong> Collected by the Central Government on intra-state supplies.</li>
          <li><strong>SGST (State GST):</strong> Collected by the State Government on intra-state supplies.</li>
          <li><strong>IGST (Integrated GST):</strong> Collected by the Central Government on inter-state supplies and imports.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>GST Identification Number (GSTIN)</h2>
        <p>Upon successful registration, businesses receive a unique 15-digit GST Identification Number (GSTIN). This number must be displayed on invoices, signboards, and other business documents.</p>

        <h2>GST Returns Filing</h2>
        <p>Registered businesses must file GST returns periodically (usually monthly or quarterly, depending on turnover and scheme chosen). Common returns include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>GSTR-1:</strong> Details of outward supplies (sales).</li>
          <li><strong>GSTR-3B:</strong> Summary return of outward supplies, input tax credit claimed, and tax payable.</li>
          <li><strong>GSTR-9:</strong> Annual return.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Timely filing is crucial to avoid penalties and interest.</p>

        <h2>Input Tax Credit (ITC)</h2>
        <p>One of the key benefits of GST is the Input Tax Credit mechanism. Businesses can claim credit for the GST paid on their purchases (inputs) and use it to offset the GST liability on their sales (outputs). Proper documentation and compliance are necessary to claim ITC.</p>

        <h2>E-Invoicing and E-Way Bills</h2>
        <p>For businesses exceeding certain turnover thresholds, generating e-invoices (for B2B transactions) and e-way bills (for movement of goods) is mandatory. These systems aim to streamline compliance and curb tax evasion.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>GST compliance is a critical aspect of running a business in India. While it might seem complex initially, understanding the basics of registration, filing, and ITC can help new business owners manage their tax obligations effectively. Seeking professional guidance from tax consultants like Tax Innovation can simplify the process and ensure compliance.</p>
